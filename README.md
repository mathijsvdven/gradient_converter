# ColorMoves XML Converter
A small command-line script that converts a colour gradient from the Colormoves project (https://sciviscolor.org/ColorMoves/) exported in XML format to an XML file that is compatible with Quantum GIS (QGIS)

Run the script from the command line in the folder containing the ColorMoves ramp as XML.
